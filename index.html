        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! Welcome to my page :) Before you scroll I want to get into a little bit about myself and what I have accomplished. I am currently a young adult attending the University of California Riverside. As of right now I am majoring in Sociology which will eventually help me go into the many fields they offer. Before college I was heavily involved in school and my community. I played two sports at the same time which were volleyball and soccer. In both of my teams I was captain and organized many of our get togethers. While playing sports I also took many honors and Advanced Placement classes to help me get ahead and be better prepared for college. I was also involved in the Students Associated Student Body Club at my school and upheld many positions like President of my class and captain for events for three years. Along with being involved with the Associated Student Body I was able to tend to my community and what we called feeder schools. Feeder schools were the elementary and middle schools nearby the High School I attended. Usually the students from these schools would eventually attend the high school I went to, Orange Vista High School. Every month we would take a trip to Triple Crown Elementary and hold assemblies for all grades, kinder through fifth grade. We held little rallies and even talked about the importance of non-bullying. We were able to make connections to these kids that would leave a mark on not only them but us as well. In addition, I helped organize our big rallies which was basically a way for us to help our school get hyped about a football game that was happening later and even a school dance. In these rallies kids were able to dress up according to the theme and show the pride they had for their class. I helped with organizing the games, script for the MC’s of the rallies, and gathering people to play the games we had planned. Along with that I also volunteered at my local elementary schools carnivals and hot cocoa with Santa. I was usually in charge of making sure everyone had the supplies needed and interacted with everyone who was there. Moreover, I was responsible for keeping my associates in line and making sure they are completing the task at hand in a timely manner. Lastly, I worked in a student store where we sold snacks items for the students at our school. SOmetimes I was on the register or took inventory so we kept track of all of our items. I even restocked our items making sure everything looked presentable. At times I even orchestrated the lunch games we had prepared for the students and made sure everyone was enjoying their time at Orange Vista High School. Finally, I was a part of organizing a heartfelt goodbye to one of our favorite janitors. We had a line of students on each side cheering him on as he was moving onto a higher position.<br><br>
